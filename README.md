# AI Chest X-ray Image Analysis

Here I deploy an AI based Chest X-ray Image analyser using StreamLit.

The Chest X-ray analyser is adapted from the AI for Medicine Specialization from deeplearning.ai on Coursera. It uses a retrained Densenet model and GradCAM to produce 'heat maps' for the areas of interest on the image, as well as the likely diagnosis.
